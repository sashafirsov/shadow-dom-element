# shadow-dom-element

is covering the typical UI tasks:
populate html slots into template using 
[Shadow DOM](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components/Using_shadow_DOM).
Slots content and template could be local in the page or pointed via URL.

## Where to use
`shadow-dom-element` is simplest web component to render HTML `template` and `slot`. 

It is meant for displaying the static content in the page or available during page load via URL. 

You do not need a [static site generator](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/performance/static-site-generator/)
as most of "components" could be expressed via template in own file. 
[There is a live sample](https://unpkg.com/shadow-dom-element@0.0.5/demo/ananke/content/en/index.html) 
of `shadow-dom-element` based templates for Ananke site generator. 
While it is not a good example of shadow dom css styling, 
it gives enough for templates embedding and use of such for building the static web site. You could play  with this 
responsive template in [Sandbox][sandbox-url].

# Use
## install
    npm i -P shadow-dom-element
## or use from CDN
```js
    <script type="module" scr="https://unpkg.com/shadow-dom-element@0.0/shadow-dom-element.js"></script>
```
The size of [shadow-dom-element.js](https://unpkg.com/shadow-dom-element@0.0/shadow-dom-element.js) 
is 1.6Kb, [compiled](https://unpkg.com/shadow-dom-element-test@0.0/dist/src/shadow-dom-element.js) to 1Kb. 
 

## API
* `promise` resolved when template and slots loaded and rendered
* `slotsInit()` initiates template and slots reading and rendering, returns `Promise<this>`
* `fetch( url )` override to load and process URL before returning a HTML string with data within slots.
Handy to use the JSON or XML as data source. Note, there is no error handling, you have to cover that case by template
and error slots. For that you could find [slotted-element](https://github.com/sashafirsov/slotted-element) handy as it 
is designed for loading life cycle.
* `applyTemplate( templateNode )` applies template to slots in sub-dom of this element as Shadow DOM. Internal method to be overridden 
by [light-dom-element](https://github.com/sashafirsov/light-dom-element) to render by Light DOM.

### Attributes
all attributes reflected as component properties
* `srcset` id of container with slots
* `src` url for html with slots
* `for` id for html template
* `code` url for html template

`<slot name=xxx attribute=abc>` is a special case of `slot` use within template: it would set the `abc` attribute of 
parent node to value taken either from `href`, `src`, or innerText of passed element with given name. 
It is needed to pass the attribute via slots. For example, link or image URL. It could be used to pass attribute to internal 
`shadow-dom-element` as within 
[summary-with-image template](https://github.com/sashafirsov/shadow-dom-element/blob/324d7de33464368c312e0bc6a9d8becc9b4dabf3/demo/ananke/content/en/index.html#L42)
for image URL.
