    Chapter VI: Esmeralda

<span slot="summary" >
    We are delighted to be able to inform the reader, that during the whole of this
    scene, Gringoire and his piece had stood firm. His actors, spurred on by him, had
    not ceased to spout his comedy, and he had not ceased to listen to it. He had made
    up his mind about the tumult, and was determined to proceed to the end, not giving
    up the hope of a return of attention on the part of the public.
